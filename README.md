### The Game
Hanabi is an [award-winning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanabi_(card_game)#Awards) multiplayer card game designed by Antoine Bauza. The game's objective is to stack cards of matching color in numerical order, similar to solitaire. Players cannot see their own hands - instead, they learn about the cards in their hand through hints given by other players.


### Technology
The app's front-end is written in React, its socket layer is written with Socket.IO, and it has a light backend written in Express. Some code (e.g. the app's Webpack and Babel configs) was borrowed from Fullstack Academy's boilerplate repository.
